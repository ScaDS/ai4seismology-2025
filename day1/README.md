In this session give an introduction to machine learning, focusing on methods for data analysis. We dive into unsupervised machine learning for dimensionality reduction and clustering. We will see how supervised methods such as  random forest classifiers work and learn about (deep) neural network architectures. Last but not least we study approached to model validation and active learning.
